Learning JavaScript
Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is for my journey into learning JavaScript. I started learning JavaScript because I want to improve my web development skills and build dynamic, interactive websites.

What Iâ€™m learning:
JavaScript basics: variables, functions, and loops
Working with DOM: how to change HTML and CSS using JavaScript
ES6+ features: arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring
Making simple web apps with vanilla JavaScript
Feel free to explore the projects Iâ€™ve created here. Iâ€™ll be adding more as I continue to learn and grow!
